# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm **Harvey McCone**

Iâ€™m a research scientist with a PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience. My work has focused on how the human brain makes decisions, combining statistical analysis and computational modelling to study the links between high-dimensional time-series EEG data and human behavior. This work has been published in peer-reviewed international journals and conferences.

This GitHub showcases my core analysis pipeline used across multiple EEG studies. It includes:

- Preprocessing (Python + MATLAB)
- Cross-language data integration
- ERP and time-frequency analysis
- Statistical testing and visualization

A complete walkthrough of my EEG analysis workflow can be found in the [eeg-analysis-pipeline](https://github.com/harveymccone/eeg-analysis-pipeline) repository. 

This pipeline covers everything from preprocessing to statistical analysis. The results of the analysis were published in the journal article:  
Signatures of time interval reproduction in the human electroencephalogram (EEG) [https://doi.org/10.1162/imag_a_00279]

## Looking Ahead

-	Over the next couple of months I will be adding code and links to additional studies that are currently being peer-reviewed for publication. 
-	To further my data science skills, I am also completing side-projects using openly available NFL player data, with the aim of trying to isolate which traits are most predictive of future performance using machine learning. I will post my findings here too!
