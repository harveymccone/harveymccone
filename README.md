# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm **Harvey McCone**

I'm a researcher with a background in cognitive neuroscience, now moving into the data science industry. My work to date has focused on conducting state-of-art experiments investigating how the human brain makes decisions. In collaboration leading experts in the field, I have completed several studies that combine statistical analysis and computational modelling to investigate the links between high-dimensional time-series data and human behaviour. I have published my work in leading international scientific journals and conferences.

This GitHub showcases my core analysis pipeline used across multiple EEG studies. It includes:

- Preprocessing (Python + MATLAB)
- Cross-language data integration
- ERP and time-frequency analysis
- Statistical testing and visualization

A complete walkthrough of my EEG analysis workflow is contained in [eeg-analysis-pipeline](./eeg-analysis-pipeline), the results of which can be viewed in the following journal article which was published last year:

## Looking Ahead

Iâ€™m looking for data scientist/analysts positions as I transition into the data science industry.

Some current things I'm working on:
- Applying innovative computational methods to improve existing models of human decision making.
- Developing my expertise in deep learning.
- Working on personal projects in SQL and R to broaden my programming skills.
